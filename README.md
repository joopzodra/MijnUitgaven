in /src/assets is csv bestand, is alleen voor development. Hoe te voorkomen dat dit meegaat met app build?

in www is de pre-populated database, maar www is in .gitignore; gaat dus niet meer github > how to exclude?

Building for production Android:

debug version:
ionic build android --prod

release version, unsigned
ionic build android --prod --release

Find the build in platforms > android > build > outputs > apk > xxx.apk

## Database uses callbacks
Contrary to what Ionic's documentation says, the database.executeSql function in database.transaction doesn't return a promise. Instead it uses callback functions.

## D3 used for detached dom elements
The charts are made with D3. D3 is used to create dummy dom elements whose attributes are used as input for creating dom elements in the Angular components. This is described in [Working with D3.js and Canvas: When and How](https://bocoup.com/weblog/d3js-and-canvas).

##  Database
On mobile devices the app used data stored in an SQLite database. In a web browser it populates a Dexie database (= Indexed DB).
